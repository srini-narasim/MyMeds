# MyMeds
SwiftUI CoreData application for learning purposes.

The application will cover several aspects of coding using the Swift frameworks for SwiftUI and CoreData.

## Coding Conventions

Since there are multiple developers involved in the project try to be informative in your commit messages. A commit message should include both the "what" changed and "why" it was changed, with emphasis on the "why". Occasionaly, the "what" is sufficient e.g. "Corrected typo in field name" 

The first line of the commit should be less than 50 characters and describe the overall purpose of the commit. Subsequent lines should be used to explain the what and why the commit was needed. 

A commit should cover a single topic and related files. If you have files unrelated to the topic being submitted, use another commit for those files.
